I am creating a program which will, extract all the equations related to that particular term

Basically you have to give list of equation e.g 
'mass*acc*cos(x)-force,1/2*mass*velocity**2-KE,mass*height*gravity-PE,displacement*time-velocity'  => basically force = mass * acc * cos(x) -> 'mass*acc*cos(x)-force
